# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Code Book #

## Objective ##
Practice collecting, working with, and cleaning a data set. 


## Raw Data Source ##
The raw data used is from a study that collected data from  the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

Full details of the raw data set can be found here:

## `Abstract of raw data set information:` ##
“The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. "

## Data Transformations performed ##
In the original data set consisted of several tables that where combined as follows to create one data set.

1. Observational data was combined with subject identifiers and Activity identifies. For both the training data set and test data set. 
2. The rows in resulting training and test data sets were combined to form one large data set.
3. Columns names where applied using the list of features provided and 
 Activity identifiers where translated to activity names using the list of activities provided.
4. The large data set was reduce to a final set containing only variables with names that include “mean” or “std”, regardless of upper or lower case. 
This includes the mean of angular calculations.  
5. The final data set was created by taking the data in step 4 and grouping by subject and activity and then sorting by subject and activity.

 
## Data Set Generated ##
The data set generate consists of 10299 observations where each observation includes the following

* Subject: Thirty subjects were observed performing various physical activities. The have identifies from 1 to 30.

* Activity: Subjects performed one of these activities:
LAYING,SITTING,STANDING,WALKING,WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,WALKING_UPSTAIRS

* Variables:  
* Each of the variables below is included in the data set
